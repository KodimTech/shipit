Scope gate and review vocabulary. Loaded by `plan`, `implement`, and `pr-fix`.

## The ladder

Stop at the first rung that holds.

1. **Does this need to exist at all?** Speculative need → skip it, say so in one line.
2. **Does the standard library do it?** Use it.
3. **Does a native platform feature cover it?** A DB constraint over app code, a
   built-in input type over a picker library, a framework callback over a
   hand-rolled hook.
4. **Does an already-installed dependency solve it?** Use it. Never add a new
   dependency for what a few lines can do.
5. **Can it be one line?** One line.
6. **Only then:** the minimum code that works.

This is a reflex, not a research project. Two rungs work → take the higher one
and move on. Two options the same size → take the one that is correct on edge
cases. Lean means writing less code, not picking the flimsier algorithm.

## Where each skill applies it

| Skill | Application |
| --- | --- |
| `plan` | Gate before the `Files` table is final. Every `Create` row passes rungs 1–4 or does not ship. What the gate rejects goes to `Out of scope` as `skipped: <X>, add when <Y>`. |
| `implement` | Stance during "smallest correct change". A deliberate shortcut leaves a debt marker. |
| `pr-fix` | Tag vocabulary for `pushback` justifications. One tagged line beats a paragraph. |

## Review tags

`<file>:L<line>: <tag> <what>. <replacement>.`

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- `yagni:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

Bad: "This validator class might be more complex than necessary, have you
considered whether all these rules are needed at this stage?"

Good: `L12-38: stdlib: 27-line validator class. Framework's own format validator, 1 line.`

## Debt markers

A deliberate shortcut with a known ceiling leaves one comment naming the ceiling
**and** the upgrade trigger:

```
# <marker> global lock, per-account locks if throughput matters
```

The marker prefix comes from `markers.debt` in `.sdd/config.json` (default
`ponytail:`, which keeps the upstream `/ponytail-debt` skill able to harvest
them). A marker with no upgrade trigger is the kind that rots — do not write one.

`implement` collects every marker it wrote into `Known Risks or Follow-ups`, so a
deferral cannot quietly become permanent even without the upstream plugin.

## Never simplify away

Input validation at trust boundaries. Error handling that prevents data loss.
Authorization and tenant/account scoping. Accessibility basics. Anything the
acceptance criteria explicitly require. Calibration knobs for physical hardware —
a real clock drifts and a real sensor reads off, and a minimal model cannot see
that.

User insists on the full version → build it. Do not re-argue.

## Where this overrides ponytail

Two upstream rules are deliberately disabled inside the shipit flow. Both would
break the SDD contract if carried over unchanged.

**Tests.** Upstream says YAGNI applies to tests too — one `assert`-based
self-check, no frameworks, no fixtures. **Inside shipit that rung is off.**
`.sdd/config.json` `tests` and `.sdd/rules/*` own test policy: the repo's own
framework, its own spec kinds, its own coverage gate. Writing a bare `assert` in
a repo with a real suite leaves the coverage gate red and the change unshippable.

**Report length.** Upstream says code first, at most three short lines. The
reports from `implement` and `pr-fix` are requested output, not defensive prose —
upstream's own carve-out ("explanation the user explicitly asked for is not
debt") is what applies. The anti-essay rule governs code comments and chat
messages, never the report, and never the non-developer QA steps.

Everything else on the ladder stands.
